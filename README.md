# 🗑️ Garbage Classification Web App

A simple web application built with **Flask** and **TensorFlow** that classifies garbage images into five categories: `cardboard`, `glass`, `metal`, `paper`, and `plastic`.  
Users can upload an image via the browser, and the app will predict the type of garbage using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
